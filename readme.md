### <ins> Description ###
My professionalism is programming. Sail around the sea and collect coins! You can use your sail to gain and lose speed by catching the wind. You cannot raise your sail, so be aware of the direction the wind is facing. There is no win condition, just a game experience. Enjoy!

### <ins> License ###
I have chosen to use an MIT license. I chose this license because this is only a small game, and I am more than happy for people to use this software without restrictions, as long as it includes the copyright notice and license. I have not decided to go with another license because I feel that there is no need for my work to be constrained in any way. I love the idea of sharing my creativity and other people having the ability to do the same.
